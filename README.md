# Character Continuity v5.1.1 Open Beta

## Protocol Placement Guard — Creator Guide

Character Continuity helps AI Dungeon portray recurring NPCs consistently while allowing temporary inner state, lasting decisions, relationships, memories, and development to survive beyond the immediate scene.

v5.1.1 combines three layers:

- **Staggered portrayal:** up to five scene-active NPCs receive individual guidance while one receives deeper focus.
- **Temporary State:** compact snapshots track Feeling, private Thought, current Goal, and Tension.
- **Durable persistence:** stricter periodic reviews may record lasting personal or relational change.

It also includes opt-in onboarding for NPCs encountered during play and detects Retry from replacement of the last visible output, even when AI Dungeon does not rerun the Input modifier.

### What v5.1.1 repairs

v5.1.1 removes a conflicting shared instruction that told the model every authorized record belonged at the end of the response. Record authorization and placement are now operation-specific:

- Temporary State and NPC-registration records must be the first nonblank output line, before story.
- Durable records must be the last nonblank output line, after complete story.
- A generation without an authorized operation—including Retry—explicitly forbids every CC5 record.
- Misplaced or malformed records are stripped while complete story survives, but they do not change continuity.

This is an open beta. Test it in a copy of an adventure and back up important cards before updating.

> **Compatibility:** Character Continuity requires the Context modifier. Cached models and Optimized Context are unsupported.

## Quick setup

1. Add the Character Continuity v5.1.1 script as a Library.
2. Connect it once to each Input, Context, and Output modifier.
3. Create `CC CORE: Full Name` for NPCs known at scenario start.
4. For NPCs to be discovered later, add their names to `CC NPC QUEUE` instead.
5. Optionally create `CC PLAYER`, `CC VOICE`, `CC MOTIVES`, and `CC BOUNDARIES` cards.
6. Start the adventure. CC creates its configuration, status, State, continuity, relationship, memory, and Turning Point cards.

Do not paste the complete script into all three modifiers. If a scenario package already connects it, do not add a second set of calls.

### Modifier calls

Input modifier:

```js
const modifier = (text) => ({
  text: CharacterContinuity("input", text)
});
modifier(text);
```

Context modifier:

```js
const modifier = (text) => ({
  text: CharacterContinuity("context", text)
});
modifier(text);
```

Output modifier:

```js
const modifier = (text) => ({
  text: CharacterContinuity("output", text)
});
modifier(text);
```

## Registering an NPC manually

Create a Story Card titled exactly:

```text
CC CORE: Full Name
```

Recommended format:

```text
Enabled: true
Aliases: Nickname, formal title
Pronouns: she/her
Significance: 3
Identity: A concise physical or social identity.
Core: The character's stable nature and defining principles.
Personality: A few durable personality traits.
Relational disposition: How she generally approaches trust, affection, commitment, and conflict.
Protected traits: Qualities ordinary story events should not casually erase.
```

Keep Core cards concise and durable. Current feelings and scene-specific intentions belong in Temporary State.

`Significance` accepts `1` through `5` and defaults to `3`:

| Value | Suggested use |
|---:|---|
| `5` | Central companion, rival, or major recurring character |
| `4` | Important recurring character |
| `3` | Regular supporting character |
| `2` | Minor recurring character |
| `1` | Background or occasional character |

Significance breaks scheduling ties; it cannot make an off-scene NPC active. Use `Enabled: false` to ignore an NPC temporarily. Leave ordinary Story Card trigger keys blank because CC discovers its cards by title.

## Discovering NPCs during play

CC never auto-registers every named character. Onboarding is opt-in through the player-editable `CC NPC QUEUE` card.

Add one unchecked NPC per line:

```text
- [ ] Mira Vale
```

Optional details may be supplied after the name:

```text
- [ ] Mira Vale | Significance=4 | Pronouns=she/her | Notes=travelling surveyor
```

The flow is:

1. CC waits until the exact queued name appears in current input or Recent Story.
2. On an eligible generation, the model may return one compact hidden registration snapshot as the first nonblank output line, based only on available story context.
3. Complete story prose must also survive. A registration-only response creates nothing and triggers prose recovery.
4. CC creates an editable `CC CORE: Name`, an optional `CC VOICE: Name`, and the normal managed cards.
5. The queue line changes to `[x]`, and the NPC can become scene-active on the following generation.

Generated Core cards begin with:

```text
Review: pending
```

Review and correct the profile whenever the first encounter was misleading. Creator edits are authoritative; CC does not regenerate or overwrite the Core or Voice profile.

If the registration output is retried, unchanged auto-created cards are removed and the queue entry is reopened. If any generated profile card has already been edited, CC preserves the corrected registration instead of deleting the player's work.

## Player identity

The optional `CC PLAYER` card helps preserve player control and grammar:

```text
Name: Azure
Pronouns: she/her/her/hers/herself
```

Common two-part forms such as `she/her`, `he/him`, and `they/them` expand automatically. Creator cards may use `{{player.name}}`, `{{player.subject}}`, `{{player.object}}`, `{{player.possessive_adjective}}`, `{{player.possessive_pronoun}}`, and `{{player.reflexive}}`.

## Optional creator cards

Use the exact NPC name from the Core card:

- `CC VOICE: Full Name` — speech style, rhythm, vocabulary, and mannerisms.
- `CC MOTIVES: Full Name` — durable needs, fears, priorities, and ambitions.
- `CC BOUNDARIES: Full Name` — creator-defined limits, consent rules, and relationship boundaries.

## Staggered focus

CC recognizes up to five scene-active NPCs from current input, Recent Story, and brief scene carryover. A clear time jump resets that carryover.

For each response, CC:

1. Finds registered NPCs involved in the scene.
2. Prioritizes direct involvement, current or recent presence, and Significance.
3. Selects one focus NPC, preferring direct involvement and then the least recently served eligible NPC.
4. Supplies compact identity and any live State for every active NPC.
5. Supplies deeper relevant relationships, memories, motives, boundaries, or Turning Points only for the focus NPC.

Player actions and Continue both participate in focus rotation. Retry repeats the discarded turn's active cast and focus.

## Temporary State snapshots

Each managed `CC STATE: Name` card can contain:

```text
Feeling: cautiously hopeful
Thought: I want the responsibility—and I hate how much it matters.
Goal: Clarify what equal authority means
Tension: Wants authority but fears overstepping
```

`Thought` is always a short first-person private thought in the NPC's own voice. It need not be spoken or explicitly narrated; grounded subtext may be inferred from Core, Voice, relationships, current input, and Recent Story.

On an eligible focused turn, the model may return one hidden leading snapshot as the first nonblank output line, containing any supported combination of the four fields. Only changed fields are returned. Unchanged fields keep their own ages, so refreshing Goal does not refresh an old Feeling or Thought.

State rules:

- Complete story is mandatory; metadata can never replace prose.
- One fixed focus owner may update per generation.
- No State snapshot is requested during startup grace, Retry, prose recovery, durable review, or NPC registration.
- Unsupported fields stay empty rather than being invented.
- State cannot decide the player's actions, feelings, consent, commitments, or relationship response.
- Each field expires independently after the configured number of successful non-Retry generations unless refreshed.
- Explicit time jumps clear prior temporary State.
- Retry restores the pre-generation State and neither updates nor ages it.

Manual edits to `CC STATE` are supported. Keep the four field labels intact.

## Durable persistence

Temporary reactions do not automatically become lasting continuity. Durable persistence remains stricter:

1. **Observe:** a completed response focused on an NPC becomes that owner's generated-story evidence.
2. **Accumulate:** later focused responses build a small evidence window.
3. **Review:** once enough observations exist, a review waits until that NPC is focused and the global cooldown is clear.
4. **Reset:** after a delivered review, that owner's reviewed evidence resets whether or not anything was stored.

Only one owner can receive a durable review in a response. The model may append one short hidden record as the last nonblank output line after complete story, but no record is correct when no lasting change was established.

Player input alone is never durable evidence. Generated story must support the stored change. Explicit acceptance or refusal of an ongoing responsibility can support a Role update even when the dialogue is brief.

## Retry and revisions

v5.1.1 saves a fingerprint of each complete visible output and its pre-generation continuity snapshot. At the next Context call:

- If the prior output still exists unchanged, generation proceeds normally.
- If it was removed or changed, CC restores the snapshot and treats the generation as Retry or revision.

Retry:

- repeats the original focus and active cast;
- occupies the discarded story-turn position rather than adding a new one;
- cannot request or apply State, durable persistence, or NPC registration;
- explicitly instructs the model to output complete story only and no CC5 record;
- cannot add durable evidence, consume cooldown, or age State;
- retains the same rollback anchor across consecutive Retries.

Complete replacement prose still survives normally.

## Configuration card

Edit values after the colon in `Configure Character Continuity` and keep the labels intact.

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Enabled` | `false` disables injection and updates while preserving cards. |
| `Context ceiling` | Maximum estimated tokens used by the continuity packet and optional task. Default: `1400`. |
| `Temporary State lifetime` | Successful non-Retry generations before an unrefreshed field expires. Default: `3`. |
| `Durable observations before review` | Focused completed responses required for an owner to mature. Default: `2`. |
| `Prose-only turns after review` | Successful turns required before another owner may review. Default: `1`. |
| `Turning Points` | `growth-only`, `all-directions`, or `disabled`. |
| `Maximum active NPCs` | Maximum scene-present NPCs included per response. Default and maximum: `5`. |
| `Debug` | Creates an additional diagnostics card when `true`. |

The ceiling applies only to CC's injection, not the model's total context window. Optional details are omitted before essential active-NPC identity. If an optional State, registration, or durable task cannot fit safely, it is deferred and story proceeds.

There is no hard output-token minimum. State and registration snapshots do consume some output space when returned. At very short output settings, complete prose remains protected and a missing snapshot leaves existing continuity unchanged. If snapshots are repeatedly absent, test a longer ordinary output setting before reporting a persistence failure.

## Managed cards

CC creates and maintains:

- `CC STATE: Name` — expiring Feeling, private Thought, Goal, and Tension.
- `CC CONTINUITY: Name` — durable personal continuity.
- `CC RELATIONSHIPS: Name` — durable directional relationships.
- `CC MEMORY ARCHIVE: Name` — significant durable memories.
- `CC TURNING POINTS: Name` — major durable development.
- `Character Continuity Status` — compact runtime information.
- `Character Continuity Debug` — optional diagnostics.

Manual edits to managed cards are supported. Keep field labels and complete relationship or Turning Point blocks intact. Avoid renaming managed cards.

The first automatic model output is suppressed. The first genuine player action receives a prose-only startup generation before hidden State, registration, or durable tasks may begin.

## Reading the Status card

The Status card reports:

- Registered, queued, scene-active, and focused NPCs.
- Which State fields exist for each NPC and the State clock/lifetime.
- Durable evidence counts and review readiness.
- Review cooldown and the last task owner.
- Candidate and update results.
- Context use by rules, NPC identity, State, relationships, memories, and task.
- Retry, Continue, fallback, and time-jump handling.

## Troubleshooting

**No configuration or status card appears:** Confirm that the script is connected once to all three modifiers.

**A queued NPC is not created:** The unchecked exact name must appear in current input or Recent Story, startup grace must be complete, and the registration task must fit. Thin evidence may correctly leave the NPC queued.

**A generated NPC is inaccurate:** Edit `CC CORE: Name` or `CC VOICE: Name`. Leave `Review: pending` until satisfied. CC will not overwrite the correction.

**An NPC is not scene-active:** Mention the registered name or an alias in current input or Recent Story. Check `Maximum active NPCs` and `Enabled`.

**State is empty:** State updates are optional and owner-bound. The model may find no supported change, the field may have expired, or the turn may have been reserved for registration or durable review.

**Thought was rejected:** It must be explicitly first person and written as the NPC's private thought.

**An owner is `ready` but not reviewed:** The owner must be focused, cooldown must be zero, and the review task must fit.

**A review stores nothing:** This is normal when evidence describes only a temporary reaction, repeats continuity, or establishes no lasting change.

**Status says `malformed stripped`:** The model returned malformed metadata or put a valid-looking record in the wrong place. Complete prose survives, but no continuity change is applied. Save the complete output and Status card before retrying or reporting it.

**A CC5 line becomes visible:** Treat it as a beta bug. Save the complete output and Status card before retrying.

**A later output is blank:** The first automatic output is intentionally suppressed. Otherwise, CC found no complete story after stripping metadata and armed prose recovery; no continuity update advanced.

## Suggested open-beta tracks

### Track A: State and voice

Use two or three active NPCs. Confirm that focus rotates, Thoughts remain first-person and character-specific, partial snapshots preserve unchanged fields, and fields expire independently.

### Track B: Durable maturation

Create one explicit lasting decision or relationship change. Watch evidence mature and confirm that a later review stores only generated-story-supported continuity.

### Track C: Retry and consecutive Retry

Retry a response that created State or a durable update. Confirm focus repeats, discarded continuity disappears, turn count does not gain an extra position, and a second Retry restores the same baseline again.

### Track D: NPC onboarding

Begin with no Core cards, queue one name, and encounter that NPC. Confirm the review-pending Core is editable and activates next generation. Retry the registration once unchanged, then repeat after editing the generated Core to test both deletion and preservation paths.

### Track E: Time jump

Create temporary State, make a clear multi-day or longer jump, and confirm State and scene carryover clear while durable continuity remains.

## Reporting beta issues

Useful details include:

- Character Continuity version.
- Model and ordinary output setting.
- Relevant Core or queue entry.
- Scene-active NPCs and focus.
- State fields, evidence counts, and cooldown.
- Normal action, Retry, Continue, or registration.
- Expected and actual story/card result.
- Complete Status card and Debug card when enabled.

Copyable template:

```text
Version:
Model and output setting:
Normal action, Retry, Continue, or registration:
Queued / scene-active NPCs / focus:
State fields:
Evidence counts / review cooldown:
What I expected:
What happened:
Time jump involved: Yes / No
Visible CC5 text: Yes / No
Story prose lost: Yes / No
Status card:
Relevant card before/after:
Other notes:
```

The most important failures are lost prose, visible CC5 records, wrong-owner updates, Retry preserving discarded continuity, Retry deleting a player-edited generated profile, stale State surviving a time jump, temporary events becoming durable, or creator edits being overwritten.
